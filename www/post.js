/* Lingua — a post (chapter 19)
   ES5 only: this runs in an old WKWebView. tools/es5-check.mjs enforces it.

   A post is a line of somebody's language with what it means fixed to it by
   the person who wrote it.

   That last part is the whole design. A machine reading an invented language
   and telling everybody else what it says is a machine guessing, and the one
   person who could catch it wrong -- the author -- is the one person who
   never sees the result. So the meaning is settled before the post exists,
   and everything downstream is ordinary translation of a sentence a human
   confirmed. 「投稿する前に、ユーザーに翻訳として自然な形はどれ？って選んで
   もらって、他の人には表示だけされる形は？」

   Three things go out, and only the middle one needs anybody's judgement:

     the line, in the letters it is written in   the author's
     what it means                                the author's, confirmed
     the gloss, word by word                      the dictionary's

   The gloss is a lookup and costs nothing, so it is there the instant you
   stop typing, offline, before any of the rest exists.

   A post keeps a copy of what each of its words meant. Six months later the
   author may decide `mos` means red rather than tall, and the post still says
   what it said the day it was written -- which is what a thing somebody
   published IS. This is the same freezing a quote needs, so there is one
   function for it.

   Posts belong to the account rather than to a language: one person, one
   timeline, and several languages to write it in. Each post says which
   language it is in and carries its name at the time.
