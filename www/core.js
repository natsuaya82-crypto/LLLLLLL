      words / lines / language name / writing system, per language
      settings (theme, plan, onboarded) once, for the person
      Everything in here is something the person wrote themselves.
      There is no starter dictionary, on purpose.

      A language used to be the only thing there was, so it was stored under
      eight flat keys -- lingua.words, lingua.letters and so on. You can make
      one language and read any number of other people's, so those eight keys
      belong to a language rather than to the app, and they carry its id:

        lingua.<id>.words          the dictionary of that language
        lingua.<id>.letters        its alphabet
        lingua.langs               which languages exist here, and whose
        lingua.cur                 which one is open
        lingua.set                 the person's settings -- not a language's

      Everything a screen reads is still a single global: WORDS is the open
      language's dictionary, not a table of every language's. The app shows
      one language at a time, because you are either writing yours or reading
      somebody else's, and 290-odd places say WORDS meaning "the one in front
      of me". They still do.

   3.6 The languages — www/i18n/en.js and its nine siblings
       One file per interface language, and everything that language needs
       inside it: what it is called, what it calls the parts of speech, how
       it writes a foreign word, and every string the interface shows. Each
       is a closure, so its tables cannot collide with the other nine and
       cannot be reached from the rest of the app. The only way in is
       defLang() above; the only way out is the object it hands back.

       The reading contract every language honours:
         syl_xx(p)    one syllable {on,nu,co}      -> that syllable, written
         word_xx(ps)  every syllable of one word   -> the finished reading
       Both are wrapped by mkApprox() below, so no screen ever learns how a
       word was cut up. Plain ES5 throughout — this runs in WKWebView.
