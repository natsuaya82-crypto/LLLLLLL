# Changelog

Changes a person using the app would notice, and every change to how data is
stored, moved or removed — whether or not anybody notices those.

Not a commit log; `git log` is the commit log. What goes here is what somebody
opening the app after an update would find different, plus the record required
by `docs/FEATURE_RULES.md` (the eleven questions) and `docs/DATA_SAFETY.md`
(DELETE REVIEW).

Newest first. Entries before 2026-08-12 are not written up — this file starts
where it starts.

## Unreleased — on `claude/save`, code confirmed, **not yet confirmed on a device**

### The keyboard and what a language is for are now in the backup

**Data. Read this one.**

`SLICES` in `core.js` is what makes a slice real: `bkPack()` walks it, so a
slice outside it is in no backup, and `wipeAll` walks it, so a slice outside it
survives a wipe into the next language. Two were outside it:

- **the keyboard** (`kb`) — built in the app, filed beside the words, and in no
  backup at all
- **what the language is for** (`wld`) — held in `SET`, the person's settings,
  so it was one answer per phone shown on every language's cover, and in no
  backup either

Neither could throw. A backup was written, it restored, every check was green,
and the keyboard somebody spent an evening building was not in the file.

- *newly stored*: `lingua.<id>.kb` was already written; it is now packed.
  `lingua.<id>.wld` is new.
- *migration*: `migrateWorld()` copies the old `SET.world` into the language
  that is open, **once**, marked by `SET.wldMoved`. The old copy is left
  exactly where it is.
- *deleted*: nothing.
- *older data*: a language with no `wld` slice gets one on the first launch
  after this, from `SET.world` if there was one.
- *the plan*: unaffected.
- `backup-check` now names `kb` and `wld` rather than counting slices, and its
  fixture language carries both. Both failures were made to happen first.

### A post can be read in your own language

**Behaviour, and new data on a post.**

A post now shows three things: the writer's own letters, what it means in a
natural language, and — on a button — the same thing said again in the
reader's own conlang, with the words the reader has no word for left in the
natural language and shown in red.

- *newly stored*: `post.tr`, translations of the meaning, written at the
  moment of posting. **Absent today**: the translator is the reader's own
  device AI and is not wired up, so `postTr()` answers nothing and every
  reader sees the language the author typed — which is what happened before.
- *migration*: none. A post without `tr` behaves exactly as it did.
- *deleted*: nothing.
- *the plan*: `tr` is a new capability, Plus. Free gets three a day, on its
  own counter (`SET.trDate` / `SET.trN`) rather than sharing the AI one —
  sharing would mean a spelling suggestion spends a reading.
- *not frozen, on purpose*: the third layer is built from the reader's
  dictionary every time it is asked for.
- *stopped storing*: `post.gl`, the word-by-word gloss. It was read in one
  place, the line under the meaning, and that line is gone — three layers, not
  four. **Posts that already carry it keep it**; nothing removes it. The
  composer still shows a gloss, which is where the default meaning comes from.

### A card of a post is drawn from the post

**Behaviour, and it only shows once a second person exists.**

Making a card of a post re-spelled it out of the open dictionary and drew it in
the open alphabet. For your own posts that is invisible; for anybody else's it
would have been their line in your letters. Cards of posts are now drawn from
the shapes frozen on the post when it was written.

- *newly stored*: nothing. `ink` has been on posts since it was added.
- *older data*: a post written before posts carried ink still falls back to the
  open dictionary — correct today, because every such post is this person's
  own. **When posts start arriving from a server they must arrive with their
  ink already on them.**
- *deleted*: nothing. A post whose ink is malformed is shown as its text; it is
  never repaired or discarded.
- `postInkOK()` is the one place that decides whether ink is drawable.
- New check: `card-check`, twelfth in `npm test`.

### A word is written on one screen, and read before it is edited

**Behaviour, visible immediately.**

- Opening a word now shows it. Editing is a button at the foot.
- The sheet that makes a new word and the sheet that edits one are the same
  screen. The new-word sheet gains several meanings, the family, synonyms,
  opposites, examples and a note — all of which were previously only reachable
  after the word existed.
- Add no longer lands on an empty form; it lands on the word.

### A word carries four more things

**Data.** All four are optional and all four are absent unless filled in.

`reg` (register: spoken / written / slang / polite), `tags` (fields, searched),
`ety` (origin), `up` (changed-on). Empty ones are deleted rather than stored.

- *migration*: none needed. A word without them behaves as before.
- *deleted*: nothing.

### Cloud storage is off the Plus screen until it exists

**Behaviour, and a promise withdrawn.**

The plans screen sold "cloud storage (new phone, several devices)" and the
settings screen told anybody on Plus "Cloud sync — On". There is no code
anywhere that sends a language to a server: the app touches `/auth/v1/*` and
`/rest/v1/profile` and nothing else.

- Cloud storage **is still a Plus feature**, deferred until there are enough
  people to justify paying for the hosting. `docs/FEATURES.md` holds it as
  planned. It comes back on the screen when the thing behind it exists.
- A switch reporting a state the app does not have is worse than no switch:
  somebody trusts it and stops making backups.
- *deleted*: nothing. Backup to Documents is unchanged and is on every plan.
- Labels removed with it: `plan.plus.4`, `set.cloud`, `set.lock.cloud.*`,
  `set.on`, in all ten languages.

### A post can carry a photograph

**Behaviour and data, on every plan.**

- *newly stored*: `post.pic`, a data URL. Squeezed to 900px on the long edge at
  q0.72 — a 2400×1600 photograph comes out about 22 KB as text.
- *not cropped*: only the long edge is brought down, and the timeline shows the
  whole picture letterboxed rather than cutting a piece off with nowhere to go
  and see it.
- **the ceiling**: `POST_BYTES` is 2 MB, about 95 photographs. `lingua.posts`
  shares one storage allowance with every slice of the language, so a timeline
  with no ceiling could make somebody's **language** unsaveable. At the
  ceiling the photograph is refused; the post is not, and nothing is pruned to
  make room.
- **`savePosts()` no longer swallows a failed write.** It was survivable while
  a post was a line of text; a post can be big enough to fail now, and a
  timeline that silently stops saving loses whatever is written after it fills.
- *migration*: none. A post without a photograph is unchanged.
- *deleted*: nothing.
- *the plan*: free, on every plan.

### The profile is where your posts are, and three things on a post

**Behaviour. One new field.**

- **The profile lists your posts.** There was nowhere in the app that did.
  The cover and the language stay at the top and the posts run under them, so
  the page scrolls where it used to be fixed. The pinned one is first.
- **The fourth icon on a post is share.** It was the card, unlabelled, and only
  on your own posts — a restriction from before `cardPaint()` drew a post from
  the post's own ink, left standing after that was fixed. It is on every post
  now, and pressing it opens the card, which is the one way anything in this
  app leaves the phone.
- **The ⋯ is a menu**: pin, and delete. It *was* delete — a delete reached by
  pressing something unlabelled is a delete waiting to be pressed by accident.
- *newly stored*: `post.pin`, on one post at a time. A page with three things
  at the top of it has nothing at the top of it.
- **The card's foot is `@handle` and the language's name.** It was the
  language's name and the word LINGUA, so a card of a language somebody had
  called Lingua read LINGUA on both sides. Both come off the post, so a card of
  somebody else's post carries their handle and their language.
- *migration*: none. *deleted*: nothing. *the plan*: free, on every plan.

### The AI is Studio's, and it is the last chapter

**Behaviour, on every plan.**

The AI conversation is not shown on Free or Plus. Plus is the tools for
building a language yourself and every one of them runs on the phone for
nothing; Studio is the plan where something helps you, and it is the only one
whose cost grows with use — a chat turn has to be given the dictionary to read,
and 5000 words is about 45,000 tokens every time.

- **It moved to the end of the contents first.** It was chapter V, between the
  notebook and the keyboard, and hiding it there would have moved the keyboard
  from VI to V under somebody who already knew where things were — which the
  keyboard row's own comment forbids. Last, it costs nothing to be absent:
  Free and Plus read I–V, Studio reads I–VI, and every shared chapter has the
  same number on both. Two numbers change once, today: the conversation V→VI,
  the keyboard VI→V.
- *the plan*: `CAN.sug` is gone. `ai` is one capability at studio, where there
  were two meaning the same ceiling.
- **Plus now spends the daily allowance for word suggestions**, three a day,
  the same as Free. It was unmetered on Plus in the code and advertised as
  Studio's on the screen; the screen was right.
- *deleted*: nothing. A Studio conversation left on the phone when a
  subscription ends stays in the `talk` slice and in the backup.

### Smaller

- The dictionary list: the whole row opens the word; a round ⊕ replaces the
  bar across the foot; the per-row play button is gone.
- The synonym / opposite picker can make a word on the spot.
- The tab bar is transparent enough to see the page through.
- The glyph editor no longer bends a line drawn straight along the dots.
- The language count is stated as `LANG_MAX = 1` on every plan, and the note
  that implied a paid plan added more is gone.

## How to add an entry

Anything that changes what is stored, what is moved, or what is removed gets an
entry **before** the code is written, with the eleven questions from
`docs/FEATURE_RULES.md` answered. Anything that deletes also gets a DELETE
REVIEW (`docs/DATA_SAFETY.md`).

Mark every entry as one of:

```
  code confirmed              npm test green, nothing on a phone yet
  device confirmed            somebody ran it on a real iPhone
```

and never let the first stand in for the second.
